      <h2>The dawn of Facial Recognition – 1960s</h2>
      <p>Many would say that the father of facial recognition was Woodrow Wilson Bledsoe. Working in the 1960s, Bledsoe developed a system that could classify photos of faces by hand using what’s known as a RAND tablet, a device that people could use to input horizontal and vertical coordinates on a grid using a stylus that emitted electromagnetic pulses. The system could be used to manually record the coordinate locations of various facial features including the eyes, nose, hairline and mouth.
        These metrics could then be inserted in a database. Then, when the system was given a new photograph of an individual, it was able to retrieve the image from the database that most closely resembled that individual. At the time, face recognition was unfortunately limited severely by the technology of the era and computer processing power. However, it was an important first step in proving that face recognition was a viable biometric.</p>
      <h2>Advancing the accuracy of Facial Recognition – 1970s</h2>
      <p>In the 1970s, Goldstein, Harmon, and Lesk were able to add increased accuracy to a manual facial recognition system. They used 21 specific subjective markers including lip thickness and hair color in order to identify faces automatically. As with Bledsoe’s system, the actual biometrics had to still be manually computed.</p>
      <h2>Using linear algebra for Facial Recognition – 1980s/90s</h2>
      <p>In 1988, Sirovich and Kirby began applying linear algebra to the problem of facial recognition. What became known as the Eigenface approach started as a search for a low-dimensional representation of facial images. Sirovich and Kriby were able to show that feature analysis on a collection of facial images could form a set of basic features. They were also able to show that less than one hundred values were required in order to accurately code a normalized face image.
        In 1991, Turk and Pentland expanded upon the Eigenface approach by discovering how to detect faces within images. This led to the first instances of automatic face recognition. Their approach was constrained by technological and environmental factors, but it was a significant breakthrough in proving the feasibility of automatic facial recognition.</p>
      <h2>FERET Programme – 1990s/2000s</h2>
      <p>The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology rolled out the Face Recognition Technology (FERET) program beginning in the 1990s in order to encourage the commercial face recognition market. The project involved creating a database of facial images. The database was updated in 2003 to include high-resolution 24-bit color versions of images. Included in the test set were 2,413 still facial images representing 856 people. The hope was that a large database of test images for facial recognition would be able to inspire innovation, that might result in more powerful facial recognition technology.</p>
      <h2>Face Recognition Vendor Tests – 2000s</h2>
      <p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) began Face Recognition Vendor Tests (FRVT) in the early 2000s. Building on FERET, FRVTs were designed to provide independent government evaluations of facial recognition systems that were commercially available, as well as prototype technologies. These evaluations were designed to provide law enforcement agencies and the U.S. government with information necessary to determine the best ways to deploy facial recognition technology.</p>
      <h2>Social Media – 2010-Current</h2>
      <p>Beginning in 2010, Facebook began implementing facial recognition functionality that helped identify people whose faces may be featured in the photos that Facebook users update daily. While the feature was instantly controversial with the news media, sparking a slew of privacy-related articles, Facebook users at large did not seem to mind. Having no apparent negative impact on the website’s usage or popularity, more than 350 million photos are uploaded and tagged using face recognition each day.</p>
